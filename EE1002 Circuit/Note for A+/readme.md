### 🎯 Achievement Unlocked:  
**"I survived school while being 90% dating, 10% panic Googling before exams."**

> _No fucking A+? No problem!_  
I was too busy swiping right on life (and potential future exes).  
Notes? What notes.

### 🧾 All I have is receipts:

- 💔 Heartbreak  
- 🧠 Scattered brain cells  
- 📱 3AM iMessage conversations instead of studying  

### 🏁 TL;DR:
**Live fast, date faster, let the GPA suffer.**
