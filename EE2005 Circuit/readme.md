# Circuits? Chill 😎  
> "I feel like circuit just chill is ok"

Welcome to the unofficial mantra of surviving (and thriving) in Circuit Theory — or whatever flavor of **EE1002 on steroids** this course is supposed to be.

---

## 🧠 Assumed Background:  
We’re assuming you’ve already survived **EE1002**, which means you’ve already stared into the abyss of KVL, KCL, Thevenin, Norton, Op-Amps, Diodes, MOSFETs... and lived to tell the tale.

So yeah, this course is basically:

> "EE1002 with a few extra spice drops" 🌶️

You’ll see some **passive filters**, maybe bump into **active filters**, flirt with **Op-Amps**, rekindle your love-hate relationship with **Diodes**, and have a deep philosophical moment with **MOSFETs** again.

But if you can walk into a problem without hesitation, solve it with pure instinct, and still look cool while doing it...

---

## 💯 Then congratulations:

> "If you can tackle the problem without any doubt, I think you must A+."

It’s not about memorizing everything. It’s about understanding enough to figure out the rest. And then being arrogant enough to pretend you knew it all along 😌

## 🔥 Pro Tips for Success

- **Chill mode activated**: Stressing = noob move.
- **Review EE1002 basics**: You'll need them more than you think.
- **Understand components**: Passive? Active? Doesn’t matter — own them.
- **Practice problems**: Not because you have to, but because you want to flex.

## 📚 Topics You’ll Probably See

- AC Circuit Analysis
- Frequency Response
- Passive & Active Filters
- Op-Amp Circuits
- Diode Applications
- MOSFET Amplifiers and Switches
- Impedance, Gain, Phase Shift – oh my!

### ⚡ TL;DR:
This course doesn't bite harder than EE1002. Just bring your confidence, a little bit of background, and the willingness to *fake it 'til you make it*.

### 🏆 Final Words:
> "Stay calm, keep solving, and let those A+ vibes flow through the circuit of life." 🚀
