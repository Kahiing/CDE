## Update
- Please note that the lecture notes may vary each year, so it's always best to refer to your own lecture materials for study.
Therefore, I won't be uploading new lecture notes here unless there is a specific request.

- I think my notes are quite useful for the **midterm**, but not so much for the **final exam** —  
Honestly, I was too lazy to write stuff down properly during the final period.

So feel free to use these notes to help you study, but don't rely on them 100% — especially near the end!
