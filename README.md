## Update
Please note that the lecture notes may vary each year, so it's always best to refer to your own lecture materials for study.
Therefore, I won't be uploading new lecture notes here unless there is a specific request.

I think my notes are quite useful for the **midterm**, but not so much for the **final exam** ‚Äî  
Honestly, I was too lazy to write stuff down properly during the final period üòÖ

So feel free to use these notes to help you study, but don't rely on them 100% ‚Äî especially near the end!
