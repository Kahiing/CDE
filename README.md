## Update

upload嘅時候先醒起每年嘅 lecture note 都可能會唔同，所以大家應該以自己嘅 lecture note 為主嚟學習。
所以呢度我唔會再繼續上載 lecture note 上去，除非你哋有特別需要。

Please note that the lecture notes may vary each year, so it's always best to refer to your own lecture materials for study.
Therefore, I won't be uploading new lecture notes here unless there is a specific request.
